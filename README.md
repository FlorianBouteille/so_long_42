A mini 2d game in C, created using the MiniLibX.

This project was a real fresh air after working with a lot of abstract concepts. It was nice spending some time on something that had a more real feel to it. 
The point was to use the MiniLibX, a small graphical library for C, to implement a minimalist game where a player gathers collectibles on a map and runs out through an exit. 
It's an opportunity to get into a heavier work environment and handle events, window management and get a first toe into the ocean of game development.
The only major difficulty is to "flood fill" the map passed as argument to make sure that it's a valid map. The idea is to recursively fill each reachable tile going in all four directions from the player, and then check if all collectibles and the exit have been reached. 

I also took the opportunity to do some basic pixel art so my game looks cool.

Emjoy !
